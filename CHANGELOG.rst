Change Log
==========

..
   All enhancements and patches to edx-enterprise will be documented
   in this file.  It adheres to the structure of http://keepachangelog.com/ ,
   but in reStructuredText instead of Markdown (for ease of incorporation into
   Sphinx documentation and the PyPI description). Additionally, we no longer
   track the date here since PyPi has its own history of dates based on when
   the package is published.

   This project adheres to Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/).

  after we have verified that all backfilled enterprise_customer fields on the assignments have been set correctly.

[3.17.23]
---------

* Fixing assessment level reporting audit retrieval.

[3.17.22]

[3.17.16]
---------

* Include course mode for the user's ``student.CourseEnrollment`` in the ``EnterpriseCourseEnrollmentSerializer``.

---------

* In ``SystemWideEnterpriseUserRoleAssignment``, Use either ``applies_to_all_contexts`` or ``enterprise_customer``
  if they are True or non-null, respectively, in determining the result of ``get_context()``,
  but continue to return list of all linked enterprise customer UUIDs if not, (which is the current behavior).
  This is a small step on our journey to explicitly defining user-role assignments.

[3.17.14]
---------

* On the ``SystemWideEnterpriseUserRoleAssignment`` model, adds an ``enterprise_customer`` FK (nullable)
  and an ``applies_to_all`` boolean field (defaults to False) that indicates if the user has wildcard permissions.
* Updates the admin to show the "effective" customer in the detail view, and the explicit value in the list view.
  The effective value is the deprecated way we currently determine role assignment -
  by implicitly assigning the role on every customer to which the user is linked.

  to which the user is currently linked.

[3.17.13]

[3.17.12]
---------

  ``LicensedEnterpriseCourseEnrollment`` records via the Django Admin site, so that site admins can manually

[3.17.5]
--------

* Ensure enterprise course enrollments return valid course run statuses such that when a learner earns a passing certificate, the ``enterprise_course_enrollments`` API endpoint deems the course is complete even though the course itself may not have ended yet per the configured dates.

[3.17.4]
--------

  only active enrollments from it.

[3.16.6]
