0013 Creating Custom Groups for Enterprise Customers
##############################

Status
******

**Accepted**

Terminology
*******
*Enterprise Group* - Collection of enterprise customer users

*Membership* - Relationship between enterprise learner and enterprise group

Context
*******

Groups is a new feature that will allow admins further customization and control of their learners. At a high level, a group is a subset of learners within an organization that can be tied to an enterprise customer's policy. A customer can have multiple policies and groups, and a learner can be in multiple groups. These changes will improve the user management and budgeting from the admin perspective, as well as adding personalization to the learner experience. In the past, we’ve used workarounds to sidestep this functionality, but with this new implementation, we will increase scalability and personalization. 

In this MVP, groups will be associated with a learner credit budget, though they are something that exists independently. Groups will allow for analytics segmentation, bulk actions, access control, and more throughout the admin experience.  

EnterpriseGroup
*********************
**Model properties**
------
- uuid, name, created, modified, history (boilerplate)
- enterprise_customer_uuid (NOT NULL, FK to EnterpriseCustomer, related_name=”groups”)

**CRUD**
------
**api/v1/enterprise-group/<group_uuid>**

Outputs
==========
The root URL for getting the basic information about the group
::
   {
        'group_uuid': 'group_uuid',
        'name': 'group_name',
        'enterprise_customer_uuid': 'enterprise_customer_uuid',
   }


**api/v1/enterprise-group/?learner_uuid=[enterprise_customer_user_id]&enterprise_uuid=[enterprise_uuid]**

Accepted Query Params
==========
- ``learner_uuid`` (optional): Get all the groups that the learner is associated with 
- ``enterprise_uuid`` (optional): Get all the groups under the enterprise

Outputs
==========
Returns a paginated list of groups filtered by the query params
::
   {
       'count': 1,
       'next': null,
       'previous': null,
       'results': [
           {
               'group_uuid': 'group_uuid',
               'name': 'group_name',
               'enterprise_customer_uuid': 'enterprise_customer_uuid',
           }
       ]
   }


**GET (list) /learners**
------
**api/v1/enterprise-group/<group_uuid>/learners/**

Outputs
==========
Returns a paginated list of learners that are associated with the enterprise group uuid 
::
   {
       'count': 1,
       'next': null,
       'previous': null,
       'results': [
           {
               'learner_uuid': 'enterprise_customer_user_id',
               'enterprise_group_membership_uuid': 'enterprise_group_membership_uuid',
           }
       ]
   }


**POST /assign_learners**
------
**api/v1/enterprise-group/<group_uuid>/assign_learners**

Inputs
==========
- ``learner_uuids`` (POST data, required): A list of enterprise_customer_user_ids to assign to the group

Outputs
==========
Returns a list of the EnterpriseGroupMembership objects that were created 
::
   {
       'count': 1,
       'next': null,
       'previous': null,
       'results': [
           {
               'learner_uuid': 'enterprise_customer_user_id',
               'enterprise_group_membership_uuid': 'enterprise_group_membership_uuid',
           }
       ]
   }


**POST /remove_learners**
------
**api/v1/enterprise-group/<group_uuid>/remove_learners**

Inputs
==========
- ``learner_uuids`` (POST data, required): A list of enterprise_customer_user_ids to assign to the group

   
EnterpriseGroupMembership
*********************
**Model properties**
------
- uuid, created, modified, history (boilerplate)
- group (NOT NULL, FK to EnterpriseGroup with related name ``members``)
- enterprise_customer_user_id (FK to EnterpriseCustomerUser with related_name of ``memberships``)
- pending_enterprise_customer_user_id (FK to PendingEnterpriseCustomerUser with related_name of ``pending_memberships``)

Consequences
*********************
Now with the implementation of groups, this will be another facet that we will filter on. Now, not all learners under organizations necessarily have equal access to content. These subsets will provide a more personalized experience for the learner, and more control for the admin.

Further Improvements
*********************
Groups will have analytics, learning goals, and other customizations associated with them in the future
