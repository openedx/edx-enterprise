--------------------------------------------------

Status
======

Pending

Context
=======

``enterprise_uuid`` will be added in the course enrollment event generated by edx enterprise and will be added to the context of ``EVENT_NAME_ENROLLMENT_ACTIVATED`` emitted by edx platform.


Consequences
============

``enterprise_uuid`` will be present in the context of ``EVENT_NAME_ENROLLMENT_ACTIVATED`` only if the user has provided an enterprise url during enrollment.
