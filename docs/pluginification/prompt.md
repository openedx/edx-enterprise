Read CLAUDE.md, proposal.md, and jira_epic_ids.txt, then recursively evaluate
all the files under `epics/` which were generated by a previous pass of AI.

Do not prompt me for reading files, you have my permission to perform any
read-only operations, even with python.  Do not modify any files without my
permission.

Things I want you to do:

* All of the epics which add a filter PipelineStep fails to successfully map the new PipelineStep to the filter.  In every case, the openedx-platform diff creates a mapping with an empty pipeline list. For example, epic 06 openedx-platform diff was supposed to map "org.openedx.learning.courseware.view.redirect_url.requested.v1" to the new pipeline step "enterprise.filters.courseware.ConsentRedirectStep", but instead the mapping is absent.  Please fix this for all affected epics.
