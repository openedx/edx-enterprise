Purpose
*******

The ``Open edx Enterprise Service`` app provides enterprise features to the Open
edX platform.  The majority of these features are structured around the concept
of an ``Enterprise Customer``, which is an organization or a group of people
that "consumes" courses published on the Open edX platform.
